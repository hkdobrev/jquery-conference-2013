[jQuery Bulgaria 2013](http://www.jquerybulgaria.com/jquery2013/)
======================

This repo **is** my presentation for the jQuery Bulgaria 2013 conference.

It is highly inspired from the two screencasts [Paul Irish](https://github.com/paulirish) recorded years ago:

* [10 Things I learned from the jQuery source](http://www.paulirish.com/2010/10-things-i-learned-from-the-jquery-source/)
* [11 More Things I learned from the jQuery source](http://www.paulirish.com/2011/11-more-things-i-learned-from-the-jquery-source/)

I try to find some interesting tricks and optimization techniques in the jQuery source code. jQuery is a very valuable resource for cross-browser scripting, good JavaScript patterns and dependency injection.

You could learn how jQuery is built from dozens of files into one long, but lean and efficient file of JavaScript. We would go over AMD, Grunt, custom builds and extending jQuery the same way a jQuery module is extending the previous ones.

Don't only learn how to do things. Always learn how things work!

The presentation is one JavaScript file which is expanded from the initial points to its full content live during the talk.
